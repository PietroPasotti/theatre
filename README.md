Theatre
=======

Theatre is a [scenario](https://github.com/canonical/ops-scenario)-based charm state-transition driver.

This is an experimental tool under development.

We plan to be able to use it to:
- aid charm development
- aid charm debugging
- aid writing scenario tests for charms

Stay tuned!

Development
